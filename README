statusd_sysbatt.lua is a statusd battery information module for notion.

This module uses sysfs interface (/sys/class/power_supply) to get battery
information. If it does not exist, you either do not have sysfs mounted
or are out of luck. It is assumed that battery directories under this path
are named BAT0, BAT1, etc. If it's different on your system, drop me a line.
Only the first battery marked as 'present' is considered.

You can use the following variables to construct the notification string:
  %sysbatt_status: 'charging', 'discharging' or 'full'.
  %sysbatt_percent_charged: '75.9%' (relative to last full charge).
  %sysbatt_time_remaining: '01:30:27 until charged' or '02:17:42 remaining'.
    May also be set to 'no time estimate' in situations when a meaningful
    estimate cannot be obtained.
  %sysbatt_hint: 'normal', 'important' or 'critical', depending on
    current charge percentage and its relation to corresponding thresholds
    (which are configurable).

Remaining time estimates are pretty inaccurate and may change non-monotonically
(but they are equivalent to the ones acpi binary provides).

To install, build the module and copy it to notion directory. On a Debian
system (assuming notion was installed using apt-get or equivalent):

  luac -o statusd_sysbatt.lc statusd_sysbatt.lua
  sudo cp statusd_sysbatt.lc /usr/lib/notion/lc/

To enable, modify the statusbar template and configure statusd to launch the
module in cfg_statusbar.lua. On a Debian system it's located at

  /etc/X11/notion/cfg_statusbar.lua

Example template entry:

  battery: %sysbatt_status (%sysbatt_percent_charged) | %sysbatt_time_remaining

Restart notion after modifications for changes to take effect.

For debugging purposes the module may be run directly:

  lua statusd_sysbatt.lua
